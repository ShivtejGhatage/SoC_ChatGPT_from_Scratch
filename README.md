## Week 1 Resources ( Necessary DS tools )



[Python in 1 Hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8)
(Just a refresher)

[Introduction to Numpy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUT1VHiLmmI)

[Introduction to Pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmEHCJofslg)

[Matplotlib](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAQNHzOcO5A)

(We recommend using VS Code for everything there is no need to use the same code editors as the tutorials)

(Can learn Plotly as well which is just interactive Matplotlib)

(Just understand the basics, Even the docs can help you plot your graphs)

## Week 2 and 3 Resources ( Neural Networks )

# Week 5
[Introduction to Pytorch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIenNRt2bjg)

# Week 6
[Final Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY)

This is from a co-founder of OpenAI (pretty good tutorial). This is what we expect as the final project. Find your own dataset, clean it and use it here.

We are fine as long the output looks like english. We know that it is easy to just copy the code. But please do it yourself to really learn whats going on.

We recommend you watch the whole video first and then code it yourself.

# Week 7 and 8 (Optional)

We have two buffer weeks in case you guys dont find enough time to complete the previous work.

In case you are done you can 

[Explore pretrained weights and Instruction Finetuning(Optional)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quh7z1q7-uc)

If you still have time you can make a ChatGPT-like web app
